    <h2>The world is going reactive</h2>

    <p>
        Not long ago, response times in the seconds were considered appropriate.  Browser refreshes were the norm in web
        applications.  Systems would go down for hours of maintenance, or even be rebooted nightly, and this was ok
        because people only expected the systems to be up during business hours.  Applications didn't have to scale
        because they didn't have big user bases.  And the complexity requirements put on web applications meant that
        typical requests could easily be handled by a thread per request model.
    </p>

    <p>
        Things are changing though.  People expect web applications to react instantly.  They expect them to be up all
        the time, while the applications are moving into the cloud, where failures are not exceptional, but rather are
        the norm, and so applications need to react to failure.  Load on a web application can peak unpredictably, to
        be many orders of magnitude greater than normal, and so applications need to react to load and scale out.  The
        complexity of business requirements means that in order to respond quickly to requests, things must
        be processed in parallel, reacting to events rather than waiting so as to utilise resources as efficiently as
        possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        This application is an example of how to implement the tenets of the
        <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Reactive Manifesto</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It uses Play, combined with the latest in client side technologies to implement a reactive user interface.  It
        uses Akka to provide horizontally scalable and resilient message passing and data management.

    <h2>Browse the app</h2>

    <p>
        Before jumping into the code, let's see the app in action.  Go to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>
        tab, and start the application if it's not already started.  Then visit it at:
        <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be presented with a screen asking for your email address.  After entering it and submitting, you should
        see a map, and you should be able to find yourself on that map (this may a short amount of time due to the way
        data flows through summary regions in the system, the further you zoom out the less realtime the app gets).
    </p>

    <p>
        If you zoom in on North Carolina, you should see some bots walking around.  These bots are simulating other
        users, the data used to generate their paths is taken from hiking trail data that was grabbed from
        <a href="http://www.hikewnc.info/" target="_blank">HikeWNC</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>System Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The system can be broadly divided into three parts.  The first part is the client side app.  This is written
        in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>, and runs in the browser.  The second
        part is the web front end, this is a Play application that serves web requests coming in.  The third part is
        the Akka backend, which manages the distribution of data across backend nodes, and the publishing and
        subscribing of events.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the demo you're seeing now, the Play web front end and the Akka backend are running as one application, but
        in a production scenario, they would be run separately, allowing fine grained control of resources between the
        front and backend.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>System Overview - Client</h2>

    <p>
        The client talks to the web front end using
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>:
    </p>

    <img src="tutorial/client-server.svg"/>

    <p>
        All the communication above is fire and forget, after sending a user moved event, the client doesn't need
        anything in response, after sending a viewing area message, the client might get many messages,
        or maybe none at all, depending on whether there are any users in that area, and after the server sends position
        updates, it expects nothing in return from the client.
    </p>

    <p>
        This differs from many traditional client server where clients make a request and expect a response. In a
        reactive application, much of the communication will not be request/response based, because the way reactive
        applications are architected is that data flows to consumers as it becomes available, and consumers of the data
        react to it, they don't ask for it.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this reason, WebSockets makes for a perfect transport for client server communication in a reactive
        application, since it allows events to be passed with low overhead, not needing to wait for a response, and
        facilitates reacting to events from the server.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>System Overview - Backend</h2>

    <p>
        Before explaining the backend interface, we need to have a short lesson in geo based systems.  A naive way to
        create the reactive maps application would be to send all data from all users to every connected user.  This
        might work if there are only 10 users connected, or maybe even 100.  At 1000, each user is going to be
        downloading megabytes of updates per second - it is not going to scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        To manage this, we break the earth up into regions.  There are many different ways to do this, but in our app
        we're using the simplest to understand, we flatten the map out into a rectangle, and then divide it into many
        smaller rectangles.  How many rectangles is configurable, but we have defaulted this to 16 million.
        Because the earth is not a reactangle, but is actually a sphere, these rectangles don't all cover the same
        area, at the equator each one is a few kms wide, at the poles, each rectangle is only a few metres wide.  But
        each rectangle is a constant number of degrees in longitude wide, and degrees in latitude high, so transforming
        latitude and longitude coordinates to regions is therefore a straightforward equation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The web front end talks to the backend using Akka clustering:
    </p>

    <img src="tutorial/frontend-region.svg"/>

    <p>
        Actors in an Akka cluster may talk to each other without knowing whether they are on the same node or different
        nodes.  In the above diagram, when a frontend node receives a position update from the client, the region
        responsible for that position may be on the same node, or may be on a different node.  The web frontend doesn't
        need to worry, all it needs to know is which region to send to, and Akka will work out how to get the message
        to the right node.
    </p>

    <p>
        Akka distributed PubSub messaging is used to publish location updates to the frontend.  When the web frontend
        gets a new viewing area from the client, it works out which regions cover that viewing area, and then subscribes
        to updates from each of those regions.  Whether those regions are on the same node or on different nodes is
        transparent, Akka ensures that the right messages get to the right subscribers on the right nodes.  When a
        region has a new update to publish, it pushes it to the PubSub manager, which then pushes the messages to the
        right subscribers on the right nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, regions get summarised into summary regions, and these summary regions are used so that clients that
        are viewing large areas at once aren't consuming too much data.  Summary regions work by subscribing to the
        location updates from their child regions, and summarising the data into clusters.  When the client requests a
        viewing area that contains too many regions, it subscribes instead to updates from summary regions.
    </p>

    <h2>GPS events - Client side</h2>

    <p>
        Now that we've got a broad overview of the system architecture, let's start looking at the code.  We'll start
        off with tracing the code through from what happens when a users GPS enabled device sends an update.
    </p>

    <p>
        The entry point to this event flow is in
        <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/models/gps.coffee" class="shortcut">gps.coffee</a>.  This file contains
        a class for for handling the GPS integration of the app.  It uses the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/" target="_blank">HTML5 Geolocation API</a> to watch for location
        updates from the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing you'll find in this, and most other CoffeeScript files in this app, is a call to
        <code>define</code>.  This is a <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> call, used to
        define a module.  RequireJS allows JavaScript to be developed in a modular way, which is important for rich
        client side apps that heavily use JavaScript like this one.  At the bottom of the file you can see a return
        statement returning the <code>Gps</code> class that we've declared, this means anything that imports our module
        will get that class back.
    </p>

    <p>
        The bulk of the code in this file is actually dealing with ensuring that neither too few, nor too many location
        updates are sent to the server.  It ensures that a location update is sent at least every 10 seconds, but no
        more frequently than every 2 seconds.  The most pertinent code that we're interested in now though is the
        <code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(...)</code> call, this is the HTML5 Geolocation API call to watch for
        GPS updates, and also the <code>@ws.send(...)</code> call, this sends a <code>user-moved</code> event as JSON
        through the WebSocket, with the users current position.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>position</code> field of this event is formatted using the <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> standard,
        which you'll soon see is used throughout the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we can now see how location updates are obtained from the browser.  But where does the WebSocket come from
        that it's getting sent down?  You'll see that the constructor of the <code>Gps</code> class accepts the WebSocket as a
        parameter.  This constructor is called from the
        <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/models/mainPage.coffee" class="shortcut">mainPage.coffee</a> module.  In
        this module, you can see that in the <code>define</code> call it declares a few dependencies, one being the
        <code>./gps</code> module that we just looked at.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scroll down to the <code>connect</code> method, and you'll see the following code:
    </p>

    <pre><code>@ws = new WebSocket($("meta[name='websocketurl']").attr("content") + email)</code></pre>

    <p>
        This is the code that creates the WebSocket, and a few lines below that, in the <code>onopen</code> callback,
        you can see where we are passing the WebSocket to the <code>Gps</code> constructor.  The URL for the WebSocket
        is coming from a meta element in the page named <code>websocketurl</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main.scala.html</a>.  This is the template
        where that meta element is defined.  The content is a call to Plays reverse router.  Play has a configuration
        file called <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a>, this file contains all the configuration
        for how incoming requests are routed to their corresponding actions in Play.  In addition to providing this
        forward routing, Play also generates a reverse router, that code such as this template can call, and it will
        return the URL that can be used to reach that route.  This means that your path information is kept in one
        place - in your routes file, and everything else in your application can depend on it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the routes file, you can see that the <code>/stream/:email</code> path is routed to
        <code>controllers.Application.stream</code>, so the reverse router call
        <code>@routes.Application.stream("").webSocketURL()</code> will return us that path.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can read more about routing in Play Framework
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaRouting" target="_blank">here</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        So now we've seen how the client side portion of the app locates and connects to the WebSocket, and how it
        uses that WebSocket to push location updates to the server.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>GPS events - Web Frontend</h2>

    <p>
        In the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file, we saw how the WebSocket route was
        defined, and how it gets routed to the <code>controllers.Application.stream</code> method.  Let's open that
        class now, <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application.scala</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking at the <code>stream</code> method, the first thing to notice is that it is declared to be a WebSocket
        action that works with <code>ClientEvent</code> messages.  These messages are defined in
        <a href="#code/app/models/client/ClientEvents.scala" class="shortcut">ClientEvents.scala</a>, we can see our
        three types of messages there, <code>UserMoved</code>, <code>ViewingArea</code> and <code>UserPositions</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest of the code in that file is formats for serialising these events to and from JSON, and for formatting
        the WebSocket frames.  We won't go into too much detail here, you can read more about Play's JSON support
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaJson" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A WebSocket represents a bidirectional stream of events, and Play, being reactive framework, uses an
        asynchronous streaming API called iteratees to manage these streams.  In this API, a consumer is called
        an iteratee, while a producer is called an enumerator.  You can read more about Play's iteratees
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        So when we handle the position updates from the client, we handle them in the consumer, the iteratee.  So the
        main piece of code we're going to focus on here is that iteratee.  It is constructed using one of the simplest
        iteratees, <code>Iteratee.foreach</code>.  The foreach iteratee simply invokes the passed in callback for each
        element in the stream.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time a <code>UserMoved</code> event is received, it's translated to a <code>UserPosition</code> object,
        and sent to the <a href="#code/app/actors/RegionManagerClient.scala" class="shortcut">RegionManagerClient</a>.
        This class is responsible for sending user position updates to the right node for the region that that position
        lives in.  You can see in that class that the first thing it does is look up the regionId, and then it creates
        a <code>UserPositionUpdate</code> message, and sends that message to a router.
    </p>

    <p>
        But how does that router get it to the right node?  The configuration for that router can be found in
        <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>.  Scrolling down to the
        configuration in the <code>akka</code> section, you'll see this:
    </p>

    <pre><code>/regionManagerClient/router {
  router = consistent-hashing
  nr-of-instances = 1000
  cluster {
    enabled = on
    routees-path = "/user/regionManager"
    allow-local-routees = on
    use-role = "backend-region"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        If you're interested in learning the full details of Akka routing and how to configure it, you can read about it
        <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/routing.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but essentially what
        this configuration means is that whenever a message is sent to the router, a hash code for that message is
        computed, and that hash code is used to decide which node in the cluster the message should be sent to -
        messages with the same hash code will always be sent to the same node.
    </p>

    <p>
        The hash code used to route messages is specified by the <code>ConsistentHashable</code> interface, you can see
        that the <a href="#code/app/backend/RegionManager.scala" class="shortcut">UpdateUserPosition</a> message
        implements this interface, and defines the hash key to be the region ID that the update is for.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>GPS events - Backend</h2>

    <p>
        We've seen how the web frontend receives GPS user position events and then routes them to the right backend
        node in the Akka cluster.  Now let's find out what happens with the events when it reaches the backend node.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the configuration for the router that we saw before, we could see this config item defined:
    </p>

    <pre><code>routees-path = "/user/regionManager"</code></pre>

    <p>
        <code>/user</code> is the namespace for all user defined actors (as opposed to actors defined by the system
        itself), so this says that the messages get sent to a user defined actor called <code>regionManager</code>,
        which is implemented by the <a href="#code/app/backend/RegionManager.scala" class="shortcut">RegionManager</a>
        class.
    </p>

    <p>
        The region manager is responsible for managing all the regions that belong on that node.  If it gets some data
        for a region, and an actor for that region doesn't exist yet, it creates it.  Once it has ensured that an actor
        exists for that region, then it sends the user position to that region.
    </p>

    <p>
        The actor class that represents a region is called
        <a href="#code/app/backend/Region.scala" class="shortcut">Region</a>.  This class has a map called
        <code>activeUsers</code>, and when it receives the user position, it adds that users position to the map.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>GPS events - Summary</h2>

    <p>
        At this stage of the tutorial, we've seen:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>How the browser gets the users position from their GPS enabled device</li>
        <li>How the browser sends the users position to the web front end via WebSockets</li>
        <li>How the WebSocket is routed to the corresponding action</li>
        <li>How the WebSocket action sends the users position to an Akka router</li>
        <li>How the Akka router routes the users position to the correct node for the region in the Akka cluster</li>
        <li>How the node receives the users position and sends it to the right actor that manages that position</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And now for something completely different.
